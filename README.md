## Architecture Designs

I've noticed recently, that I have a notebook full of designs for projects
that I have:

1. Never started, and have abandoned
1. Never started, but soon will
1. Started, but have abandoned
1. Started, and completed

I think it's time to transition to a more digital format. At the time of this
writing, my digital design tool of choice is [draw.io][1].

## Current Designs

- ProxyWings
- The Sweeper
